1. Create a repository under your personal github account and fork it to signaling systems when it is ready for publication or outside collaboration. (Open the repository in Github, click on "fork" on the top right, then click on signalingsystemslab.) After publication, alternatively transfer ownership of the repository to signaling systems lab following this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository). Specify signalingsystemslab as the new owner.
2. You can keep your repositories private until they are publication ready. Info [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility).
